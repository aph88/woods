The intention of this project is to make a very basic html canvas game as a way of refreshing my java ascript coding skills.

Steps to do:

1. Set Up canvas to display a grid of one tile

2. Set up canvas to display a grid of tiles based on the contents of an array

3. Fix up map generation algorithm.

4. Get main character to display on top of defined map.

5. Add event listeners to handle input.

6. Collision detection for environment.
